# Random Link Website

## Description
Companion website to my other repository 'random_links_api'. On this website you pick one of three categories, "fun link", "game link", or "news link". You will be given a random link pertaining to one of these categories. The website does this by making a call to my api, which can provide a random link of one of the categories from my Google Cloud SQL database.
